# EnSDD

R package supporting the paper **"EnvSDD: Spatial Domain Detection with
Microenvironment-aware Graph Attention"**.

We propose EnvSDD, a microenvironment-aware spatial domain detection framework that integrates spatial
adjacency and microenvironment similarity, derived from deconvolved cell-type compositions, within a
graph attention autoencoder to learn discriminative spatial embeddings.
